1. Boolean values in C++

C++ uses true and false as boolean values. true is equivalent to 1, and false is equivalent to 0.

2. Conditional statements in C++

C++ supports:

if/else
else if (there is no elif)
switch-case
C++ doesn't have unique conditional statements like Perl's unless. It sticks to the standard use of if and else.

3. Delimiting code blocks in C++

Code blocks in C++ are delimited using curly braces {}. If a condition block contains only a single statement, the braces are optional but should be used for clarity and to prevent potential logical errors.

4. Short-circuit evaluation in C++

C++ uses short-circuit evaluation:

&& (logical AND) short-circuits if the first condition is false.
|| (logical OR) short-circuits if the first condition is true.
