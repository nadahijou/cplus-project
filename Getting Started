To get started with C++, first, install the language on your system. 
On Windows, download and install Microsoft Visual Studio, selecting the “Desktop development with C++” workload. 
For macOS, install Xcode from the App Store and then use Terminal to install Xcode command line tools with the command xcode-select --install. 
On Linux, use the terminal to install the GCC compiler with sudo apt install g++, or Clang with sudo apt install clang. C++ does not come with a single recommended programming environment; however, popular choices include Microsoft Visual Studio for Windows, CLion for cross-platform development, Code::Blocks for a simple IDE, and Eclipse CDT for an open-source option. 
I selected C++  because its another famous program. 
To run C++ programs, open your command line or terminal, navigate to your project directory, compile your program with g++ -o hello hello.cpp or clang++ -o hello hello.cpp, and then execute it with ./hello on Linux/macOS or hello.exe on Windows. 
Comments in C++ can be written using // for single-line comments and /* ... */ for multi-line comments, allowing you to document your code clearly and effectively.


#include <iostream>  // Include the iostream library for input/output

int main() {          // Main function where execution begins
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;  // Print Hello, World! to the console
    return 0;         // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
